## Description

A Python ðŸ“¦ for getting point and gridded climate data by AOI. `climatePy` is the Python version of the [`climateR`](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR) R package, providing all of the same functionality but in Python.

As its stated in the [climateR README](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR#climater):
climatePy simplifies the steps needed to get climate data into Python. At its core it provides three main things:

1. A climate catalog of over 100,000k datasets from over 2,000 data providers/archives. See (`params()`)

2. A general toolkit for accessing remote and local gridded data files bounded by space, time, and variable constraints (`dap()`, `dap_crop()`, `read_dap_file()`)

3. A set of shortcuts that implement these methods for a core set of selected catalog elements

## Installation

`climatePy` can be downloaded from PyPI via `pip` like so:

``` 
pip install climatePy
```
**Note:** climatePy is still in **development**

<br>

## Usage

### Loading climate catalog

```python
import climatePy
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load climate catalog
catalog = climatePy.params()

# load example AOI data
AOI = gpd.read_file('src/data/san_luis_obispo_county.gpkg')
```
<br>

### Using `climatepy_filter()`:

The `climatepy_filter()` is one of the core functions of `climatePy` and is used to do the first round of filtering on the base climate catalog.

Here we filter down our climate catalog to TerraClim precipitation data for San Luis Obispo County, CA.

```python
# collect raw meta data
raw = climatePy.climatepy_filter(
        id        = "terraclim", 
        AOI       = AOI, 
        varname   = "ppt"
        )
```

| id  | asset | varname    |
|-------|-----|---------|
| gridmet | agg_terraclimate_ppt_1958_CurrentYear_GLOBE  | ppt   |

### AOI

<br>

### Getting climate data in AOI

Now lets use the `getTerraClim()` function from `climatePy` to get precipitation data for January 1st, 2018 in San Luis Obispo County, CA.

```python
# collect raw meta data
prcp = climatePy.getTerraClim(
    AOI       = AOI,
    varname   = "ppt",
    startDate = "2018-01-01",
    endDate   = "2018-01-01"
    )
```

<br>
<br>

### Get data within a date range

We can also get data within a date range. we'll use `getTerraClim()` to get monthly precipitation data for all of 2018 in San Luis Obispo County, CA.

```python
# collect raw meta data
prcp = climatePy.getTerraClim(
    AOI       = AOI,
    varname   = "ppt",
    startDate = "2018-01-01",
    endDate   = "2018-12-01"
    )
```

### Data from known bounding coordinates

`climatePy` offers support for `shapely` bounding boxes. Here we are requesting wind velocity data for the four corners region of the USA by bounding coordinates.

```python
from shapely.geometry import box

bbox = box(-112, 34, -105, 39)

bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[bbox], crs ='EPSG:4326')

vs = climatePy.getGridMET(
       AOI       = bbox, 
       varname   = "vs",
       startDate = "2018-09-01"
       )
```
